          <p>ADI tries to cultivate a culture of learning and innovation among students at Columbia. We want students to feel empowered to build anything, and hold events to help them in the process:<p>
          <ul>
              <li>Every spring, ADI hosts DevFest, a week-long series of technical workshops culminating in a 24-hour hackathon. DevFest focuses on fostering community, and helping new developers end the week with a completed project. </li>
              <li>ADI coordinates a communal, on-campus living space, where students interested in technology and innovation live together and learn from one another.</li>
              <li>Every Wednesday night, ADI hosts Cookies & Code, where student developers meet one another, share feedback on code, and eat cookies.</li>
              <li>ADI hosts a yearly job fair in the fall for student developers to connect with New York tech startups in a low-key and casual environment. Last year we hosted twenty companies and over 250 students.</li>
              <li>ADI hosts weekly workshops and tech talks, bringing professional developers to campus to teach students their expertise. In addition, ADI hosts student-run talks, during which students teach each other skills they have developed.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>ADI hosts and manages technical projects for the Columbia community.</p>
          <ul>
              <li> ADI curates <a href="learn.adicu.com">learn.adicu.com</a>, a resources page for people interested in learning to program.</li>
              <li>Students in ADI build <a href="courses.adicu.com">courses.adicu.com,</a> a schedule builder for Columbia students.</li>
              <li>ADI built <a href="data.adicu.com">data.adicu.com</a>, an API for accessing Columbia's data, from housing to dining to athletics.</li>
          </ul>
