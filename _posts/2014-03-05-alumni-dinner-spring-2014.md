On February 28, we held the second ADI alumni dinner of the school year. Our alumni graciously took time out of their busy lives to socialize and eat with us youngins, and we can't be grateful enough that they did! It really was a wonderful night of good food and new (and old) friends.

If you don't believe us, check out the pictures below! Obviously, people are smiling because they had a great time.
