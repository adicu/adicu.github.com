    <p>Are you interested in Scala, the hip new functional programming language that the likes of Twitter and Foursquare are using? Do you like Chipotle? If either of these (preferably both) are true, this talk is going to be right up your alley!</p>

    <p>Ryan Hendrickson, a 5th year Technology Associate from MIT is pioneering Bridgewater's use of the Scala language in their research department.  The tech talk will be around what Bridgewater, the world's largest and most successful hedge fund, is building in order to model, simulate, and visualize global economic systems from a web browser.</p>
