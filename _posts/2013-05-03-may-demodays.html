    <p>
    This Saturday, NYU and the Columbia Application Development Initiative (ADI) are co-hosting this final Spring DemoDay to bring everyone together for awesome collaboration and community! <br></br>
    This is a great opportunity to see the creative results of folks from both ADI, NYU and the tech community at large, in the setting of a NYC startup! <br></br>
    In case you're new around these parts, here's how it works: <br></br>
    Students present dope projects: handful of 2-minute demos, a few 5-minute demos, <br></br>
    Guest speaker from the NYC community rocks the house (John Ensor Parker from Nature of Energy and Peter Bell from HackNY are here!), <br></br>
    Eat pizza & hang out with us !<br></br>
