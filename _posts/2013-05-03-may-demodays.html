This Saturday, ADI and Tech@NYU are co-hosting this final Spring DemoDay to bring everyone together for awesome collaboration and community! This is a great opportunity to see the creative results of folks from both ADI, NYU and the tech community at large, in the setting of a NYC startup! 

<br></br>
In case you're new around these parts, here's how it works:

<ul>
    <li>Students present dope projects: handful of 2-minute demos, a few 5-minute demos</li><br/>
    <li>Guest speakers from the NYC community rock the house</li><br/>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="{{ page.john_park }}">John Ensor Parker from Nature of Energy</a></li><br/>
        <li><a href="{{ page.peter_bell }}">Peter Bell from HackNY</a></li>
    </ul><br/>
    <li>Eat pizza & hang out with us!</li>
</ul>
